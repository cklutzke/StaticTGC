This is a project-in-progress to develop a single-page web application so customers can purchase targeted categories of Game Crafter products.

GETTING STARTED

1. Make sure you have current versions of git and npm on your local machine.

2. Globally install vue-cli 3 (currently in beta) by running "npm install -g @vue/cli". Confirm that you installed version 3 by running "vue -V".

3. Clone the desired branch of this repo to your local machine.

4. Install all dependencies automatically by running "npm install" in the project root directory.

5. Run "vue ui" to start the vue-cli console. Open the project. Run the Serve task. This will serve the project on localhost:8080 with hot reloading.
